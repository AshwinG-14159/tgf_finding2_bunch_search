There was too much confusion in the original repo present in the sem_5_content folder (repo name TGF_finding). Going to use this new repo to separate out the bunch searches and work with them



Outside this git repo, at the same level as it. Keep a folder big_data and witin it keep folders results_csv_peaks, plots, mkfs.

Within mkfs, download relevant mkfs and keep. orbitinfo.csv is in data folder within repo. scripts are in scripts folder.

within plots, make folders histograms and scatter, along with other folders for plot storage based on various searches that will be run.


Use bunch_search_new.py for the searches
